Usov. After graduation, I entered Ivan Schastny Grodno State Electrotechnical College, where I chose a direction in the field of electrics. University years were a period of active search and self-discovery for me. During my studies, I actively participated in student life, became a part of various student clubs.\n\nIn addition to work and study, my interests also include includes macro photography and photography and sports.I always try to diversify my life and continue to develop myself.\n\nIn life, it is important for me: family, friendship, kindness, honesty, diversity, self-development and others. I always try to live according to my principles and benefit others.\n\nAt the moment, I am striving to study programming, or to be more precise, Front End development. I believe that my efforts and efforts will lead me to success and allow me to contribute to society.\n\nMy life is full and exciting, and I am glad for all the opportunities and challenges that I have experienced.
